# Permutations-of-Arrays
This Java code hands out all the permutations between the common elements of two arrays. 
I'm more like a beginner in Java, so there might be some redundancies and way more efficient ways of handeling all of that. 
But anyways, I hope I am able to help you and furthermore beeing able to track my own progress with my code snippets.
